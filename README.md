# SNN Demo
_Implementing the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) from first principles_

Welcome to the the SNN Demo repo. Explore the sample code, notebooks for a demonstrable example of SNN models explained from first principles.

# Guides

You can browse the [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks (.ipynb extension) and read through, or run them on your local machine. 

__To run them locally you need to do the followings:__

1. Check the dependecnies and install the required packages.
2. Download the USPS dataset [[2]](https://www.kaggle.com/bistaumanga/usps-dataset) and save it on your local directory.
3. Run jupyter notebook and open one of the ipynb files.
4. Excecute each cell from top to bottom consecutively.
5. Enjoy.
